        <h2>About Doom</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Victor_von_Doom_(Earth-616)" target="_blank">Victor Von Doom</a> is the King of
          Latveria, the nation known as the jewell of the Balkans. Raised as a humble Romani, Doom traveled the world learning
          the secrets of both science and magic. Using his massive intellect and natural superiority over other men, 
          Doom returned home to overthrow an unjust king and seize the throne. Doom stands above all world leaders in his 
          love for his people. His rule is just yet firm. Doom is power. Doom is destiny. One day the whole of existence may be threatend, 
          and on that day, the world's only hope will be Doom.

        <h3>Doom Armor</h3>
        <p>
            Do you find your grand schemes frequently derailed by so-called "heroes" with seemingly unbeatable
            powers? Worry no more. Doom has you covered. Literally. Dr. Doom's <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor_Doom%27s_Armor"
            target="_blank">full-body armor</a> has become an essential part of his branding. He's never seen without it (for good reason!). But his armor is more 
            than just a symbol. It is a nearly indestructable defensive measure, able to withstand all but the most
            brutal of attacks. But that's not all! Doom's armor is also loaded with offensive capabilities. Doom will 
            customize your armor to your needs, and he'll even throw in a cloak in the color of your choice, at no extra
            charge. Remember: The best defense is an overwhelming offense.
