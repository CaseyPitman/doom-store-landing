            inferior S.H.I.E.L.D. <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Life-Model_Decoy" target="_blank">
            Life Model Decoy</a> technology and upgraded it as only Dr. Doom can - by fully integrating

        <h3>Ultimate Nullifier</h3>
        <p>
            Do you ever have those days where you just want to destroy all of existence? Do you believe 
            you deserve the power to annihilate even the most powerful of cosmic entities? Doom understands. 
            That is why he has created his fully functional <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Ultimate_Nullifier_(Weapon)"
            target="_blank">Ultimate Nullifier</a>. Based on schematics stolen directly from the secure databases at
            the Baxter Building, Doom's Ultimate Nullifier puts the power to dispatch a god in the palm of your hand.

        <h3>Doom Armor</h3>
        <p>
            Do you find your grand schemes frequently derailed by so-called "heroes" with seemingly unbeatable
            powers? Worry no more. Doom has you covered. Literally. Dr. Doom's <a href="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Doctor_Doom%27s_Armor"
            target="_blank">full-body armor</a> has become an essential part of his branding. He's never seen without it (for good reason!). But his armor is more 
            than just a symbol. It is a nearly indestructable defensive measure, able to withstand all but the most
            brutal of attacks. But that's not all! Doom's armor is also loaded with offensive capabilities. Doom will 
            customize your armor to your needs, and he'll even throw in a cloak in the color of your choice, at no extra
            charge. Remember: The best defense is an overwhelming offense.

      <h2>Pricing</h2>
      <p>Remember: You get what you pay for. Doom's work is the best, and as such commands a steep price.
         Pricing is dynamic. Multiple factors affect the price of any one item. Economic conditions, availibility
         of materials, and your reputation in Doom's eyes can all affect the cost of your item. Discounts given
         for bulk orders and professions of fealty to Dr. Doom.
